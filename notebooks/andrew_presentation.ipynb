    "Porches are a structure typically located near the front of a building, and are a common sight in numerous houses.  They typically cover the entrance of a house, and come in two main types: enclosed and open porches.  Enclosed porches are more like an extra room in front of the house, as they are surrounded by walls (though they are typically made of glass or screens).  On the other hand, open porches forgo the protection of the walls against the elements and the outside world in return for a more scenic experience to experience the outdoors.  \n",

    "As they are a popular commodity in many houses, we want to see how the price will change between a house that does have a porch and does not have a porch."

    "In the scatterplot above, we plot both the square feet of the house's enclosed porch area and their open porch area, and then classify their color based on their sale price,  with low-end housing at a gray color and luxury housing at a dark green color.  Common trends we can see are that the number of houses with an enclosed porch area is significantly less than houses with an open porch area.  We can assume this is so because of cheaper material costs as well as open porch areas being more aesthetically pleasing.  Another point we can take is that houses with porch size below 800 square feet, whether it be open porch or enclosed porch, have a wide variety of sale prices.  However the main point is that all houses with a large open porch area, or an open porch area above 800 square feet, are considered expensive housing.  With these points we can analzye that just having a porch does not correlate exactly to a high sale price, but you need a large porch to a certain degree."

    "Unlike porches, beachfront and lakefront housing are significantly more rare.  Both are housing that contain access to a lake or beach on their property, and are typically considered a prized commodity due to people's fascination with water.  While normal houses can be built anywhere that there is suitable land, beachfront and lakefront housing requires access to limited space around a body of water, which leads to scarcity and low supply.  To simplify our terminology, we will combine the two phrases beachfront and lakefront into a singular term waterfront."

    "To get a better sense of the difference in price range between different waterfronts, we will take a look at this plot here.  With our non-waterfront price range at the top, it is clear that it is quite limited in comparison to the properties in the other areas.  While not all non-waterfront properties are properly portrayed due to the removal of significant outliers, the majority of the properties in waterfront areas sit at a comfortably higher price range.  We do notice two glaring things that stand out, mainly the areas of Duwamish and Lake Wash.  Duwamish is a noticable case where its price range is significantly lower than all other areas, including non-waterfront properties.  We expect that this is due to the poor ecological state of the Duwamish river due to heavily pollution in the past, which makes it a poor choice to build houses for residential purposes.  On the other side of the spectrum, we have Lake Washington which has ridiculously high housing prices due to the prime real estate.  Many mansions and luxurious homes reside here, including one owned by Bill Gates himself.  As Duwamish and Lake Washington are clearly out of the norm, we will consider them as outliers and not include them unless specifically requested by a customer."
